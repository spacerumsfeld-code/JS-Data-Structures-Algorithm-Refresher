# Javascript Data Structure/Algorithm Refresher
by Nick Papadakis
# Introduction
Hello and welcome to the Javascript Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA) Refresher! This is a brief romp through the key essentials of data structures and algorithms. The goal of this project is to jog your memory of some of the key fundamentals of computer science and programming, then allow you to test your skills against a complete test suite. As you have surmised from the title, we will focus on implementing these concepts in Javascript.

# Who Should Use This
The target audience for this project are those wanting a refresher in DSA, who want a proper test
suite to assess their work. Additionally, those already quite familiar with DSA but who are not
familiar with Javascript may gain utility seeing implementations in the language.
# How to Use
Begin with Section 1 and proceed in numerical order from there. As you proceed, take a gander at the Practice Problems Section to test your knowledge -- each block of practice problems comes with a test suite to assess your progress.

# Get Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run "npm install"
3. Proceed to Section 1!
4. Visit Section 0 and attempt the practice problems once you have completed a section; for your convenience, the following scripts are available:

# Scripts
<color="red">npm run test</color> : run the entire test suite!\
 + npm run test-recursion
 run the recursion test suite\
npm run test-searching : run the searching algorithm test suite\
npm run test-sorting : run the sorting algorithm test suite\
npm run test-stack : run the stack test suite\
npm run test-queue : run the queue test suite\
npm run test-SLL : run the singly-linked list test suite\
npm run test-BST : run the binary search tree test suite\
npm run test-binary-heap : run the binary heap test suite\
npm run test-priority-queue : run the priority queue test suite\
npm run test-hash-table : run the hash table test suite\
npm run test-graph : run the graph test suite
